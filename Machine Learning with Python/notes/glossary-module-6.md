## Rain Prediction Project (Example Application)

**Weather Prediction**
Using machine learning to forecast meteorological conditions like rainfall, temperature, or humidity.

**Binary Classification (Rain Prediction)**
Predicting whether it will rain (Yes) or not rain (No) on a given day.

**Weather Features**
Variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and cloud cover used to predict rainfall.

**Target Variable (Rain)**
The variable indicating whether rain occurred (typically "Yes"/"No" or 1/0).

**Temporal Data**
Data that includes a time component, important for understanding seasonal patterns and trends in weather.

**Seasonality**
Regular patterns that repeat over specific time periods (e.g., rainy seasons).

**Class Imbalance (Rain)**
When the number of rainy days differs significantly from non-rainy days in the dataset.

**Feature Engineering (Weather)**
Creating new features from raw weather data, such as rolling averages, lag features, or derived metrics.

**Evaluation for Imbalanced Data**
Using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC rather than accuracy alone when classes are imbalanced.
