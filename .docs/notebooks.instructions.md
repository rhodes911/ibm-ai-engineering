# Notebook Guidelines

- Use Jupyter notebooks for experiments and labs.
- Always start with a "Setup" cell that imports dependencies, sets random seeds, and configures the environment.
- Break down workflows into small, logical cells to improve readability and reusability.
- Use markdown cells to explain the purpose and outcome of each code block.
- Keep outputs short; summarise long results or logs in text.
- Use charts and tables where appropriate to visualise results.
- Save a copy of the notebook with outputs cleared before committing if large outputs are not essential.
