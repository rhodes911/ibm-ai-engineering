## 🎯 Learning Methodology

### For Each Lesson:
1. **Comprehensive Notes** - Detailed markdown notes with real-world examples (300-500+ lines)
2. **Glossary Updates** - Every new term added with definitions and examples
3. **Practice Labs** - Hands-on Jupyter notebooks with:
   - Every line of code commented
   - Glossary references throughout
   - Real-world datasets
   - Visual demonstrations
   - Practice exercises

### For Quiz Mistakes:
1. **Study Guides** - Targeted analysis of wrong answers with diagrams
